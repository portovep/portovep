### Hey, I'm Pablo! 👋

🤓 Technical lead at [@Thoughtworks](https://thoughtworks.com) <br>
🇪🇸 Born in Galicia, Spain

### About me 👨‍💻
I’ve worked in tech for over 10 years. I am currently building decentralized data systems and empowered high-performing teams at Thoughtworks.

Over the years, I have helped startups build MVPs fast, scale-ups improve their software engineering practices to achieve fast flow and stability, and large enterprises implement modern architectures like microservices and data mesh.

I’ve also played a variety of roles, some of these include: full stack engineer, infrastructure engineer, agile development trainer, data engineer, tech lead and tech principal.
